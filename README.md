## Concentration

[Github deployment](https://suleecao.github.io/concentration-game/)

* The game features a 5 by 6 grid and its aim is for the user to find as many matching images in the fewest number of tries. The game is over when player accuracy dips below 55% or if all the cards have been matched.

* This version of concentration has a rocks and minerals theme. I picked similar looking minerals to make it more challenging.

* The game will play a synth sound when the player wins. 

* The game is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I selected it as a simpler project because I see some similarities between it and the tic-tac-toe exercise from earlier.

**Future Thoughts**
I would like to make dark mode with a toggle, to add a sound that plays when the player loses, and another button to switch themes, possibly polished stones. It would also be thoughtful to let the player select the grid size between small (20 cards), medium (30 cards), and large (40 cards) with a pop up window at the beginning on a landing screen.
